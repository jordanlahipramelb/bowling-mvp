## Features

The main goal of **Bowling MVP** is to allow a user to track their game of bowling in order to assist with keeping a record of frames and scores.

Many people are unsure of how to calculate a bowling scorecard. **Bowling MVP** assists these users by calculating each frame for you by utilizing user input of how many pins were knocked down, if the frame is a strike, or if it is a spare.

The application consists of a database that allows users to create leagues and teams, associating users with teams and teams with leagues, setting a schedule of which teams are competing with one another on each league, and searching for nearby bowling alleys. These features were implemented in order to provide a user with a clean and organized way of storing and displaying information to a vast database of bowlers, teams, and leagues.
